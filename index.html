        Hey everyone! My name is Neil, I'm studying at BYUI and my major is in computer science. I am from Des Moines, Iowa.</p> <p> I love programming and so I hope I can get into a career with coding involved.
Some hobbies that I like are watching movies, playing all sorts of games, photography, exercise, and chilling with the homies.</p><p>
I'm taking web design because I find it super interesting and I think using code to be creative is awesome.
