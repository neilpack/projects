        Hey everyone! My name is Neil, I'm studying at BYUI and my major is in computer science. I am from Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
         <p class="butter"> I <span class="beans">love</span> programming and so <div>I</div> hope I can get into a career with coding involved. Some hobbies that I like are watching movies, playing all sorts of games, photography, exercise, and chilling with the homies.</p>
<p class="butter"> I'm taking web design because I find it interesting and I think using code to be creative is awesome.
